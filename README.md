# Computational Theory

This repository contains the work for the Computational Theory module, where I was given 8 tasks to complete. These tasks are completed in the file "tasks.ipynb". Required imports can be found in "requirements.txt".

For each task, the file contains:
- A description of the task.
- A summary of how I completed the task.
- References of useful sources used in completing the task.
- The script to complete the task.
